To use this application, you will need to install a couple of things:

1. We used argparse for the argument parsing, so you need to do a 'sudo pip3 install argparse'
2. Next you need espeak, so you need to run 'sudo apt-get install espeak'
3. Wolfram alpha was used to ask questions and receive answers, so use 'pip3 install wolframalpha'
4. Cryptography was used for communication so use 'pip3 install cryptography'
5. Tweepy was used to get twitter tweets with specific hashtags, so use 'sudo pip3 install tweepy'

Everything else used (pickle, os, sys modules) should come preinstalled on a python 3 installation.

You of course need speakers to hear the text to speech, and use a connection between the two devices to set things up.
